excerpt: Twitter sure is great, and Oprah sure did a good job bringing up the number
  of subscribers. But as successful as it is, it is immediately obvious to me that
  we need to move on to something better. As Twitter grows, it only becomes more and
  more painfully obvious how centralized systems such as it do not scale well, and
  how a distributed system would be much better. It seems to me we have the two specifications
  we need for it, too.

<p>Twitter sure is great, and Oprah sure did a good job bringing up the number of subscribers. But as successful as it is, it is immediately obvious to me that we need to move on to something better. As Twitter grows, it only becomes more and more <i>painfully</i> obvious how centralized systems such as it do not scale well, and how a distributed system would be much better. It seems to me we have the two specifications we need for it, too.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>OpenID</h3>
<p>This is the simplest distributed means of identification that I know. I use it here at philihp.com. All you need is a domain, or some domain (such as livejournal or AOL/AIM) to vouch for your identity. I can't imagine doing it any other way, really. Discovery would be really simple, too.</li>
<li>
<h3>RSS</h3>
<p>A standard way of sharing stories. All a distributed Twitter would need to do, is ignore anything past the 140th character in the description of an item. The LINK node could be treated as a link to the GUID of the item an item is in reply to.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you were to follow me, you would follow my OpenID, <code>philihp.com</code>. Similar to how OpenID does it, in the HTML of the page served by going to <a href="http://philihp.com">philihp.com</a>, there would be a &lt;link&gt; tag pointing to where the distributed RSS XML document of my tweets would be served.</p>
<p>Sure, I'm sure some details still need to be ironed out... and talk is cheap. Anyone who has read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blondie24-Playing-Kaufmann-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1558607838">Blondie24: Playing at the Edge of AI</a> knows: implementing something that works usually takes an order of magnitude longer to do. And it takes a further order of magnitude longer to figure out why it was a bad idea.</p>
<p>And yes, I am posting this while Twitter is down.</p>
