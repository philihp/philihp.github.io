<p>It's easy to get carried away and overpack. Maybe you need an extra suit? You never know when you'll need to go somewhere formal. Might want to bring your hiking shoes too, in case you find time to explore the local wilderness. Don't forget a book, in case you can't sleep on the plane. Also a backup book, in case you don't want to read that book.</p>
<p>It took me a while to realize I probably won't need all of this.</p>
<p>Similarly, as I've grown as a software developer, I've realized that most of what I write won't be needed. Reusable code is great, but only if you reuse it, and it's better to deliver something that works on time. If it lasts for a while, and you find you need it to be performant, then think about refactoring later. Chances are you won't need to.</p>
<p>Leave the charger for your electric toothbrush at home. Worst case, your motorized toothbrush runs out of juice, and it just becomes a normal toothbrush.</p>
