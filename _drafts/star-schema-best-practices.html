<p>Here are some tips that have helped me out.</p>
<p>Suffix fact tables with _fact<br />
Suffix dimension tables with _dim</p>
<p>Having a fact and dim table with the same name is probably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">code-smell</a>, so make sure you have a good reason. </p>
<p>Name dimension IDs as the table name + "_id", for example "customer_id" for a customer_dim table.</p>
<p>Use the same name of the dimension_id when possible (not always possible, since you might have "bill_address_id" and "ship_address_id" and an address_dim table with just "address_id".)</p>
<p>Include a "count" field in the fact table with "1" in every row. This comes in very convenient for summations.</p>
