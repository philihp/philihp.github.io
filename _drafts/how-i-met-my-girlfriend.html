<p>I know, I try to only post things of substance, but for every rule there is an exception.</p>
<p>When someone asks you how you met your girlfriend, they are really inviting you to invent the most ludicrously fantastically incredibly shocking story you can possibly imagine. You are allowed to embellish, and encouraged to invent as many details as your mind will allow; all in the interest of entertaining your listener.</p>
<p>Now from what I read here, what actually happened was maybe you picked her face out from the crowd of one of your concerts. This is both impressive and sweet. Impressive because your concerts are enjoyed by several hundred, if not thousand faces. Sweet, because out of all of those people, she stood out. Something about seeing her inspired you to give one of the best performances of your life.</p>
<p>Then some interval of time passed.</p>
<p>Through what can only be described as divine fortune (and in no way could come off as being the creepy actions of a stalker), through incalculable odds, your paths cross... maybe she was sitting next to you on a plane? You exchange a few words, then part ways.</p>
<p>Another interval of time passes.</p>
<p>Then maybe you meet in a bookstore. Of course you recognize each other, but neither of you is sure the other does; then you both catch yourselves looking and decide to get coffee and talk about the events of the last two intervals of time, and discover how no matter how different you are, you still get along well and continue to be friends.</p>
<p>A shorter interval of time passes.</p>
<p>Mutual friends of yours should become romantically involved, and you form a clique of friends. You get the picture... basically just say anything that happened in When Harry Met Sally, but try not to make it too obvious.</p>
