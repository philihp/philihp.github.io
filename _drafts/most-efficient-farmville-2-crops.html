<p>So I'm up to level 9, and I've been working on maximizing my profits in FarmVille 2. The real money is made in crafting, and Strawberries give the most exp/time. Extra money should be spent buying lemon trees, so when you open up the kitchen you'll have something to quickly craft there and make some quick money. Then once you get to level 6, the only thing you should ever farm/craft is <b>Onions &amp; Broth</b>. Reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Onions are on a 12-hour clock, which means it's easier to do this in the morning and in the evening</li>
<li>Onions give 14 exp per day. Wheat or Pumpkins would give 12, Strawberries would give 13, and anything else is limited by water.</li>
<li>Cooking Onions into Broth requires one fuel, and turns 6 onions (value 180) into 1 broth (value 420), "adding" 240 coins in value.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find yourself with extra fuel, make and sell strawberry lemonade (6 lemons, 5 strawberries, and 3 cooks adds 408... so every cook, on average, adds 136 coins).</p>
<p>If you find yourself with extra water (you shouldn't), water your lemon trees.</p>
