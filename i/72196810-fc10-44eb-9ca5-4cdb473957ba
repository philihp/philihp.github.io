this is the switch for the kitchen sink garbage disposal.

if it stops working, it may be because of a jam. pull the power before doing
anything, there's an outlet under the sink on the bottom left, behind
everything. try to fish out whatever it is with tongs. you can also stick
a quarter-inch allen wrench into the center of the bottom of the unit
and turn the mechanism manually. after you think it's clear, plug it
back in and press the reset button (underside on the right side).
