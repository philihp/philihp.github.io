mount is for the X-Sense XP0A-MR smoke and carbon monoxide detector.

if you're having a "wtf?" moment with the holes, the previous mounting holes were from XS01-M smoke detector, i tried to reuse one of them and made three anchored holes, but then they weren't level so i adjusted and only used two.

fwiw i think the top hole might go into a stud. the drill didn't push through once i got through the lath. i considered just anchoring on that, but that complicates the unit being twisted to attach and detach from the mount.
