swapped out this outlet with https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZJC751K/ this outlet because it has 2.4A USB-A and 3A (PD) USB-C. the previous outlet had its wires curled the incorrect direction, so that was fixed. it is on the same circuit as the outlet to the left of it on the wall which is GFCI protected, so if that trips then this one will also go out. additionally that other outlet has a weird wood screw on the bottom anchor. i have no idea what that's about.

hope that helps.
