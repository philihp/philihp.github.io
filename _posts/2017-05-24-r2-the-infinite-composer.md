<p>For the <a href="https://stupidhackathon.github.io">San Francisco Stupid Hackathon</a>, I wrote a program that would convert your keystrokes and mouse clicks into random tones. It was inspired by <a href="https://www.1014.org/code/nullsoft/nbeep/">nbeep</a>, and I wrote it in a few hours having absolutely no idea what I was doing beforehand. It turns out, macOS programming is a lot like iOS. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ueRSEVY.gif">Neat</a>!</p>
<p>It can be installed with:</p>
<pre>brew cask install philihp/casket/r2</pre>
<p>Postmortem: What did I learn? It's actually very difficult to build something like this. Even my own brain was trying to trick me into making something useful.</p>
