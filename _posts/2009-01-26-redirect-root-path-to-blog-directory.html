<p>I've just setup an HTTP Redirect from <a href="http://www.philihp.com/">www.philihp.com</a> to <a href="http://www.philihp.com/blog">www.philihp.com/blog</a>. This makes it so people don't see my ugly project listing when they come here, they go right to the blog. I still wanted people to be able to go to the root path, though, because a lot of times whenever I put some small project, gizmo, or widget up, I'll just stuff it in a new directory from the root path. I settled on allowing only listing when the HTTP header value HTTP_REFERER begins with a path from my blog.</p>
<p>To replicate this again elsewhere, create an <code>.htaccess</code> file in your root directory and put in it (or it if it exists, append to it) the following:</p>
<pre>RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www.philihp.com/ [NC]
RewriteRule ^$ /blog/ [R,L]</pre>
<p>The first line turns mod_rewrite on. It's off by default to make serving static files very fast, but mod_rewrite is very fast, and we need it anyway, so turn it on. RewriteRules come in chunks, where every RewriteRule has the RewriteCond<em>itions</em> that came immediately before applied to it. So the second and third lines come as a chunk, which reads "If the path is empty (i.e. root path), and the HTTP_REFERER[<em>sic</em>] variable does not (<code>!</code>) begin (<code>^</code>) with <code>http://www.philihp.com/</code>, send the request to <code>/blog/</code>. But wait, I have 2 flags, <code>R</code> to Redirect instead of <a href="http://www.giantgeek.com/blog/?p=109">Forward</a>, and <code>L</code> because this is the Last rule we need to process for this request.</p>
<p>The bad thing about this practice is similar to the problem we used to have where <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200411/who_framed_the_web_frames_and_usability/">HTML frames would break bookmarks</a>. A user might go to the directory listing and bookmark it, but if they return, their HTTP_REFERER is different, and the redirect would trigger. But in my case, that's not a terribly terrible to the user.</p>
<p>It's not too difficult for a malicious attacker to craft their own HTTP_REFERER tag, so be careful depending on it for anything where security is a priority.</p>
