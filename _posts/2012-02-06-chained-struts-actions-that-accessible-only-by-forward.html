<p>So I just stumbled into doing this little trick. It may go against some pattern, or best practice, but I'm sure there's a use for it somewhere.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://struts.apache.org/1.3.10/">Struts 1.3</a> (and probably any Struts 1.x), it is sometimes useful to have a request chain across multiple Action classes, maybe to break them up into more manageable sections. But maybe you don't want step-2 of a multi-Action process be accessible externally. If you configure your Actions like this in your <code>struts-config.xml</code>, you can do just that.</p>
<pre lang="XML">
<action path="/refresh" type="com.philihp.action.RefreshPartOne">
  <forward name="default" path="/refresh#2.do" />
</action>
<action path="/refresh#2" type="com.philihp.action.RefreshPartTwo">
  <forward name="default" path="/" redirect="true" />
</action>
</pre>
<p>To trigger it, have the user goto <code>/refresh.do</code>. Struts will call RefreshPartOne.execute(), and assuming it returns the default ActionForward, it will call RefreshPartTwo.execute().</p>
<p>If the user tries to call <code>/refresh#2.do</code>, they will get an error. The browser will strip out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier">fragment identifier</a> from the URL and tell the server it wants to see /refresh, which doesn't exist. It may be possible to carefully craft a request to the server though, and it's up to your container (e.g. Tomcat, Glassfish) to strip out the fragment. Behavior is probably undefined because <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt">RFC 1738</a> says the '<code>#</code>' is unsafe and should never be sent in a URL. So test it out if you're really curious.</p>
