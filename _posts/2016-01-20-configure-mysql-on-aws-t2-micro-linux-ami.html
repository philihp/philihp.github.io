<p>I moved my blog over to an AWS VM, because I get 12 months of a free <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">t2.micro</a> instance. Can't beat free hosting for a year, right? And about $10/month after that, on my own private virtual machine. Assumed things were going well, but I came back a few weeks later to find everything had gone to hell. Wordpress was not connecting to the database.</p>
<pre>[philihp@philihp.com ~]$ sudo service mysqld start
Starting mysqld:                                           [FAILED]</pre>
<p>In looking at my <code>/var/log/mysqld.log</code> file, I found</p>
<pre>160120 21:49:58 mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /var/lib/mysql
160120 21:49:58 [Note] /usr/libexec/mysql55/mysqld (mysqld 5.5.46) starting as process 27540 ...

160120 21:49:58 [Note] /usr/libexec/mysql55/mysqld: Shutdown complete</pre>
<p>The important thing here is <code>InnoDB: mmap(137363456 bytes) failed; errno 12</code>.</p>
<p>It looks like it couldn't allocate the memory, which makes sense because a t2.micro instance only has a gig of RAM. Ought to be enough for anyone, right? Not for MySQL! The way to fix this is to open up your <code>/etc/my.cnf</code> file, and add a param <code>innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1M</code> (something reasonable). If you haven't made any other changes, it should look similar to this:</p>
<pre>[mysqld]
datadir=/var/lib/mysql
socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
# Disabling symbolic-links is recommended to prevent assorted security risks
symbolic-links=0
# Settings user and group are ignored when systemd is used.
# If you need to run mysqld under a different user or group,
# customize your systemd unit file for mysqld according to the
# instructions in http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Systemd

innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1M

[mysqld_safe]
log-error=/var/log/mysqld.log
pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid</pre>
<p>Now if you start MySQL back up, everything should be fine.</p>
<pre>[philihp@philihp.com ~]$ sudo service mysqld start
Starting mysqld:                                           [  OK  ]</pre>
