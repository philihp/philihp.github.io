<p>Hi friends. I've been learning a lot of things recently, but nothing cool enough to be worth an entire blog post of its own, so here they are.</p>
<h2>Weblabora</h2>
<p>I've been resurrecting <a href="http://github.com/philihp/weblabora">Weblabora</a> recently by abstracting out the game logic into a JAR and rewriting the front-end with more modern technology. The front-end is also open source on <a href="https://github.com/philihp/kennerspiel/">Github</a> and will be hosted at <a href="https://kennerspiel.com">Kennerspiel.com</a>. Not much to see right now, but I am making slow and steady progress. The idea, this time, is to make it so that more games can be added relatively easily.</p>
<p>A JAR of the game library is published to Maven repositories is the first JAR I've published under the com.philihp group <a href="http://maven-repository.com/artifact/com.philihp/weblabora">http://maven-repository.com/artifact/com.philihp/weblabora</a>.</p>
<h2>Sailing</h2>
<p>Lately I've been learning how to sail. The other day in practicing man-over-board drills in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J/24">J/24</a> we spotted a watermelon floating in San Francisco Bay. We rescued it and ate it for lunch.</p>

<h2>Portland</h2>
<p>For the second half of 2015 I will be living in Portland, Oregon. That's about all there is to say about that.</p>
