<p>I thought this was neat and quirky. The implications of it are important, too. When you assign a macro variable in SAS, it doesn't resolve immediately. It resolves  It will also warn you if the variable doesn't exist yet, too.</p>
<pre lang="SAS">%let x = &y;
%let y = z;
%put &x;</pre>
<p>Will output</p>
<pre lang="text">z</pre>
<p>Even though, when x was defined, y did not exist. We'll get the following warning, which can be ignored. </p>
<pre lang="text">WARNING: Apparent symbolic reference Y not resolved.</pre>
<p>As far as I can tell (I could be wrong!), I don't think there's a way of turning off that warning.</p>
