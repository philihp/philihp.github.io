- 20 grams garlic
- 40 grams of butter
- 0.5 liter chicken broth.
- 0.25 liter milk
- 800 grams pasta with high surface area
- 30 grams parmesan or pecorino romano
- (optional) 15 grams of vermont white cheddar
- (optional) 1-2 grams of salt
- (optional) 1-2 grams of pepper corns

Smash the garlic and mince it as fine as you can get, this should take at least 10 minutes to maximize allicin production, which stops once you added to heat. Melt butter in pot on high heat. Add garlic and cook on high until brown but not blackened. Add chicken broth first, then milk, then pasta. Bring to boil and then reduce to a simmer. Stir often to avoid burning milk fats. In a small pan, on high toast peppercorns, then grind and add to pot. After about 20 minutes the pasta wll absorb the water, keep stirring. Once pasta is mostly tender, add cheese. Stir until stirred.
