<p>Raleigh BarCamp registration is open. <a href="http://barcamprdu2009.eventbrite.com/">Register here</a>, and do so soon to stake your seat! I couldn't make it to last year's, but look forward to this year's.</p>
<blockquote><p>A BarCamp is an unconference where people interested in a wide range of technologies come together to teach and learn. ... Rather than having scheduled speakers, everyone pitches sessions the morning of the BarCamp. Those sessions are put on a schedule, and lots of little groups form for intense group learning. Everyone is expected to teach, to talk, to participate. Yeah, its different from a regular conference - but it works!</p>
<p>The idea of an unconference came together when people realized the best times they were having at conferences were the times between sessions - where people with like interests could meet ad hoc. The goal of BarCamp is to facilitate this type of interaction for an entire day. We supply the food, the space, the wireless, the projectors - you show up to teach and learn.</p>
