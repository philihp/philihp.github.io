  This weekend only, World of Goo is 75% off on Steam. This is down from an
  already low $19.95 to a mere <b>FIVE DOLLARS</b>. This is your chance to join
  the morally elite who
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism"
    >pay for the things they consume</a
  >. Strange concept, I know.

  World of Goo is one of an increasingly few games to be released without any
  DRM. It's an indie game developed by
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_Boy">two renegade EA developers</a>.
  It's also

    >available on Linux</a

  as well as Windows and the Wii! It was released in 2008 with almost universal
  acclaim scoring a
  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/worldofgoo"
    >94% on Metacritic</a
  >.

  For all the nerd-rage on the internet about how much we

  suggests that gamers are just

  >.

<p>
  Help reverse this trend. Support indie games. Buy this. It's
  <i>five dollars</i>. You will probably spend more on lunch today.
