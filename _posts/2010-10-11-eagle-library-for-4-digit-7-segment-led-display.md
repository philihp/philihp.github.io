I made this EAGLE library for the LTC-4027JR 4-digit common cathode 7-segment
super bright red LED clock display. As of right now, they're
[$3.96 on Digikey.com](http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?vendor=0&keywords=LTC-4727JR). Since each digit has a common cathode, I have to multiplex the digits to
display numbers larger than 9. The library can be used in EAGLE to make
schematics and board designs.

DISCLAIMER: I don't know what the hell I'm doing. I'm just really proud of
this, and wanted to share it with the internet.
