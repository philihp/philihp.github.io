    The term Mode 7 originated on the Super NES video game console, on which it
    describes a simple texture mapping graphics mode that allows a background
    layer to be rotated and scaled. By modifying the scaling and positioning of
    the layer on a scanline-by-scanline basis, a simple perspective effect can
    be applied, transforming the layer into a 2-dimensional horizontal
    texture-mapped plane that trades height for depth. Thus, an impression of
    3-dimensional graphics is achieved.

  Basically, for lines on the screen, when they're at the top, scale the texture
  smaller. When they're near the bottom, scale the texture bigger.

  Immediately makes me remember Super Mario Kart and F-Zero. This is how they
  did the fake 3d perspective of the ground before titles like Star Fox came
  out;and it also explains why the barriers on the racetracks always appeared
  flat, whereas in games like Stunt Race FX, the barriers were solid. What I
  didn't realize, was that
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VI">Final Fantasy VI</a>
  also used this trick for the world map. Neat.
