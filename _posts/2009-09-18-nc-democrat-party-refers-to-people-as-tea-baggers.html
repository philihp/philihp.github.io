<p>You keep using <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=teabag" target="_blank">that word</a>. I do not think it means what you think it means.</p>

<p>Democratic strength continues to grow</p>
<p>Democratic leaders from across the country met last week in Austin, TX for the Democratic National Committee's Fall Meeting.</p>
<p>In addition to electing a slate of organizational and caucus officers, Democrats learned about the rebirth and growth of the Democratic Party in Texas and the strength of our gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia. </p>
<p>North Carolina continues to lead the way with DNC Member Susan Burgess' pitch to host the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, where she serves as Mayor Pro-Tem.  </p>
<p>Joyce Brayboy and Ed Turlington were elected at-large DNC members. Turlington and Everett Ward were elected to the Resolutions and Credentials committees, respectively, with Ward elected as co-chairman of his committee. </p>
<p>David Parker was also elected Treasurer of the Southern Caucus. Spanning states from Virginia to Texas, the caucus discusses regional issues and concerns. DNC Chairman Tim Kaine said the organization will continue to focus its efforts on winning elections in the South. </p></blockquote>
