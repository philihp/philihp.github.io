<p>It looks like <a href="http://www.servlets.com/archive/servlet/BrowseList?listName=struts-user&by=thread&from=96820">someone</a> had this error in 2006, and it was never resolved. I am posting this, hoping that in 2018 someone will have the same issue again, and the <a href="http://xkcd.com/979/">wisdom of the ancients</a> will not fail him.</p>

WARNING: Form 'myFormBean' not found for locale 'en_US'</pre>
<p>In Struts 1.3, when you see this error in your code, it's because you have a ValidatorForm specified in your struts-config, and Struts is trying to instantiate it, and wondering what validator rules it follows. The validator is looking in your validation.xml file (the thing specified in the plug-in element in your struts-config.xml file), and not seeing any mention of your form. The bit about the locale is a red herring; <b>every Form bean that extends ValidatorForm listed in struts-config.xml must have a corresponding form element in validation.xml</b>. It doesn't matter if your ValidatorForm does all of its own validation in <a href="http://struts.apache.org/1.3.10/apidocs/org/apache/struts/validator/ValidatorForm.html#validate(org.apache.struts.action.ActionMapping, javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest)">validate()</a>. Everything will work, but if that empty element isn't in validation.xml, you will get this annoying warning, and if you <a href="http://visualstudiotips.wordpress.com/2006/04/16/tip-treat-warnings-as-errors/">treat warnings as errors</a>, then you're probably wondering how to fix it.</p>
<p>To fix it, add an empty form element to validation.xml, like this:</p>
<pre lang="xml">
<form-validation>
	<formset>
		<form name="myFormBean">
	</form></formset>
</form-validation>
</pre>
<p>Please use this knowledge to save us from the Ko-dan armada.</p>
