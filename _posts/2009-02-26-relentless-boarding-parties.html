<p>
  Aaron Dixon - Saul<br />
  Paul Houlbrooke - Apollo<br />
  Sean George - Tyrol*<br />
  Chris Rabeler - Baltar<br />
  Phil Busby - Roslin<br />
  Ken Mather - Boomer*
</p>
<p>
  To shake things up this game, and keep people from picking characters they've
  been before, everyone picked the character for the person to their right going
  clockwise. Paul made Aaron be Saul first, then it went down in the order
  above. Phil picked Chris to be Baltar because he's such a horrible horrible
  human anyway. Ken picked Phil to be Roslin so Chris wouldn't be president.
  Aaron picked Ken to be Boomer so he could be admiral.
</p>
<p>
  Apollo draws Missing G4 Explosives as the first crisis to put Boomer in jail
  as she starts in the armory. Tyrol puts in 1, pass, pass, Boomer says she'll
  take care of it and puts in 3 cards. It fails, and there's a blue 5 point
  skill card in it, so Boomer goes to jail, but she accuses Tyrol of sabotaging
  the check. It's pretty suspicious though, so Roslin and Saul both think
  Boomer's a cylon. Food Shortage advances jump track. Roslin cherry picks Water
  Sabotage to advance the jump track, then a Survey Team, Forced Water Mining,
  and Rescue the fleet all advance the jump track for a quick first jump. Saul
  takes us 3 distance for 2 fuel. Good Saul.
</p>
<p>
  Tyrol draws Declare Martial Law, and the presidency goes to Saul. Then a
  Raiding Party, but the jump track is at 0, so we just get some friends.
  Scouting For Water pushes the jump track up, then Low Supplies, then Besieged
  giving us a base star and friends on the board. Apollo draws Network
  Computers, and it passes, but Tyrol is all like "oops, blind devotion (his
  once per game) says it failed", so instead of advancing jump twice, it goes
  back once and gives us a boarding party. Tyrol's turn is next too, and he
  reveals sending Baltar to sickbay so he draws only 1 skillcard next turn.
  Crap. He leaves and goes to the Armory, rolls, and hits a lucky 7 removing the
  boarding party. Baltar draws Analyze Enemy Fighter advancing the jump track,
  but activating raiders to blow up 3 ships to kill 3 pop. Then a Jump Control
  Failure pushes jump back one, and population is now in red which is good for
  making sure the sympathizer sides with humans, but it really is the worst
  thing to be in red because it inhibits sprinting through jumping early. Boomer
  draws Elections loom to advance the jump track, but three heavy raiders are
  about to board. [caption id="attachment_356" align="alignright" width="300"

  >[/caption]Saul's turn, Boomer says she has two max firepowers to fire on
  them, probably killing or at least getting rid of two of three, so he
  executive orders her for two actions. But instead, she scouts twice for bad
  crises and high-fives Cylon-Tyrol. Technically it was better than execing
  Apollo, because if Apollo were a cylon, he'd get 3 actions in a row; but we
  had all forgotten about suspecting Boomer was a cylon from the beginning. She
  decides to stay a "human" so she can still bomb crises and use her
  once-per-game. So crises suck for a while, Cylon-Tyrol hits us with his
  supercrisis, Fleet Mobilization, which fails from already low cards, and
  advances the heavy raiders further. Baltar manages to shoot at a boarding
  party killing it, but draws the Guilt by Collusion crisis which fails from a
  bad skill check. Roslin cherry picks a jump counter with Water Shortage.
</p>
<p>
  We jump past 4 distance, and the sympathizer is neutralized going to the
  already cylon Tyrol. Heavy raiders urgently need to be killed, as they're at
  2/4 (we lose at 4/4). Saul moves to the President's Office, and says he has an
  Authorization of Brutal Force, so the plan is he execs Roslin to use her
  once-per-game and hopefully draw the other Brutal Force, Apollo execs Saul to
  use the president's office, so in total there are 6 quorum draws, and Baltar's
  turn to adapt, and maybe Roslin's turn to do something. And since Boomer
  didn't reveal, unless someone's crisis activates heavy raiders, Saul and
  Apollo will get turns. [caption id="attachment_358" align="alignleft"

  >[/caption]So Roslin is exec'ed, but doesn't draw it. Saul is exec'ed, uses
  the office to draw one, doesn't get it, uses his Brutal Force in hand as the
  second part of the office, then as his second action uses the office to draw,
  doesn't get it, so he draws another as the second part and doesn't get it.
  Cylon-Tyrol's turn uses Cylon Fleet to push the boarding party further,
  they're right on the edge now. Baltar's turn, he execs Apollo to use the
  armory twice, but we're all out of Strategic Planning cards so we have two 25%
  chances of hitting (a little less than a 50/50 chance). He misses both times
  with a 2 then a 3, so the Strat Planning wouldn't have helped anyway. He draws
  Boarding parties, immediately activating heavy raiders, and the humans lose.
</p>
<p>
  Before the second jump, humans could have jumped early to bring pop down to 3
  at half-time and save the ship from boarding parties, but having 3 pop is
  really rough. I guess having two cylons actively sabotaging stuff before
  half-time is really devastating for the humans.
