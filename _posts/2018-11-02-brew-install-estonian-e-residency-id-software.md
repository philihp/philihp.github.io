Assuming you have <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> installed, tap
<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-eid">this cask</a> and
install via the following commands

<strike>
```
brew tap homebrew/cask-eid
brew cask install eid-ee
```
</strike>
```
brew cask install philihp/casket/eid-ee
```


That's it.
