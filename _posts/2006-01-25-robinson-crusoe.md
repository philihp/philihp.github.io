I fed the full text of Robinson Crusoe, delimited by spaces without regard to spaces, into a 2nd-order markov hash, layered on top of a 1st order markov hash (with tokens rearranged). Using the original first three opening words, "I was born", the program randomly generated this:

"All this while I sat upon the ground, looking out upon the sea, at about the distance of about eighty yards."
