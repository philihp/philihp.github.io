By default, `ssh-keygen` will generate 3072-bit RSA keys, which very smart people say is sufficient.

One of these keys might look like this:

```
ssh-rsa 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 philihp@jinteki.local
```

As a binary embedded in a QR code, this could look like this:

[![](/assets/id_rsa3096.png)](/assets/id_rsa3096.pub)

If sufficient is good enough for you, then there is no reason to read this post, but if you want to be a special snowflake, then upgrade to an ed25519 key!

## Enter ed25519

[Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) keys are really short because instead of your key being two prime factors, you can just use any random noise as a private key, and generate your corresponding public key from that. Generate them like this:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

This creates a really slim key, so in all of your `authorized_keys` files, you'll just look like

```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIO/hBOfgryiHaeNkhjwehgKWIyTgNAvHbPiNPCrCyWd5 philihp@jinteki.local
```

And if for some reason you want to turn this into a QR code, this would look like

[![](/assets/id_ed25519.png)](/assets/id_ed25519.pub)

There are absolutely valid reasons for you to do this for security reasons... but of these, none of them is urgent. The thing that's urgent for right now is vanity. Who wants a large 4096-bit key when you can have a key 10% that size, and perhaps more secure? I'll tell you who. You. You want that.

These are also compatible with [GnuPG](https://www.gniibe.org/memo/software/gpg/keygen-25519.html)
