<p>In film making and photography, the <b>Martini shot</b> is the last shot of the day. According to Dave Knox, it is named so because "the next shot is out of a glass"<super><a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781400097593&view=excerpt">1</a></super>.</p>
<p>The second to last shot of the day is the <b>Abby Singer shot</b>. As an assistant director, near the end of a day of shooting, Abby Singer would say "this and one more" so the crew could begin to tear down parts of the set.</p>
<p>Named after Elian Gonzales' aunt, the <b>Marislasis shot</b> is the third to last, the <b>Maya Angelou shot</b> is the fourth to last shot, and the <b>Lou Nidus shot</b> is the shot before lunch.</p>
