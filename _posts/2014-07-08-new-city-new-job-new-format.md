I have relocated to San Francisco, and I now work at [Airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com/c/pbusby) as a Software Engineer.

Unfortunately, this blog will probably not see many more SAS-related posts until I can get my hands on a license. It will probably see a lot of new blog posts with newer, freer technologies. I'm learning a lot of Ruby and Rails, so expect some cool stuff on that front.

Also, I'll probably drop more [F-bombs](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=F+-+Bomb).
