<h1>R2: The Infinite Composer's Keyboard</h1>

<p>This is a program that plays a note every time you press a key on the keyboard, or click a button on your mouse. You need to add the program to your
accessibility-enabled programs, otherwise you only get the mouse clicks and not the keypresses. I wrote it in about 6 hours, without having any prior knowledge of how to write macOS apps. As such, I take no liability, but really how much damage can no more than a few dozen active lines of code do? Since this is effectively asking you to install itself as a keylogger, it had better be open source.</p>

<p>Because an infinite number of monkeys at an infinite number of keyboards might eventually write Shakespeare, but why not also have them mine for Mozart as well?</p>

<h2>Install</h2>

The easiest way to install this is if you have <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> installed, running:

<pre>brew cask install philihp/casket/r2</pre>

If you prefer not to run brew, you can download and extract this file:

<a href="r2.tgz">r2.tgz</a> (<a href="r2.tgz.asc">pgp</a>, <a href="r2.tgz.md5">md5</a>, <a href="r2.tgz.sha1">sha1</a>)

<p>Download the zip and unzip it. If you run it, it will prompt you to open your computer's accessibility security settings, because it's totally a
keylogger and OSX will only make beeps on mouse clicks unless you add R2 to the list of cool programs. You need root to do this.</p>

<h3>Minimum Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A computer running Mac OS X Lion</li>
</ul>
