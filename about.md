This is the personal website of Philihp Busby.

I am a software engineer from Raleigh, and currently in San Francisco. I've worked for [SAS Institute](https://sas.com), [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com), and [Anomalie](https://dressanomalie.com). I also enjoy playing european board games and implementing them digitally.
