I'm very passionate about the Bitcoin Lightning Network. It minimizes miner fees making crypto more environmentally responsible, and makes transactions actually instant, avoiding the 10 minute delay for block confirmations. If blockchain is like a banking check settlement platform, lightning is like a credit network.

If youâ€™re a Lightning node operator and would like to open a channel, please get in touch. I prefer my peers to have a minimum average channel age of 30 days, and that we cooperatively adjust fees to target a balanced channel; if I find most payments route toward you, I will raise my fee. If they route toward me, I will lower my fee.
