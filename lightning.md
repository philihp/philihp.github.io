I'm very passionate about the Bitcoin Lightning Network. It minimizes miner fees making crypto more environmentally responsible, and makes transactions actually instant, avoiding the 10 minute delay for block confirmations. If blockchain is like a banking check settlement platform, lightning is like a credit network.

If you’re a Lightning node operator and would like to open a channel, please get in touch.
