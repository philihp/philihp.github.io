extracting 3g of phlostigon to equalize into the 1.5L vessel of CO2 leads to a balance of 70 psi. extracting from the vessel leads to most of the remaining phlostigon being retained, although experiments lead to phlostigon being heavier than air (indicated by one's voice being deeper). as such, since the insertion and extraction is done from the top, with the vessel collecting sediment, we should ensure that the container remains closed forever.
