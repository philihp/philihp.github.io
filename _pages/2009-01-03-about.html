<p>I'm a 28 year old programmer in Raleigh, NC, USA. I have a beagle, and I am married to <a href="http://www.carleemallard.com/">Carlee <s>Mallard</s> Busby</a>.</p>
<p>Here, I like to write entries about interesting things. Sometimes I write entries about cool stuff I've done. Often I like to write entries about obscure technical problems to which no one has bothered to publish the solution. While they may not have broad appeal to droves of people, I like to think it has saved a few programmers many hours of stress and made the world (if ever so slightly) a better, happier place. You might consider prefixing every programming-related entry with "DEAR PEOPLE OF THE FUTURE: I had that same problem! This is what I've figured out:"</p>
<p>I like to play board games too, mostly German ones. You can find me on <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/philihp">BoardGameGeek.com</a>. Lately, I've been into:</p>
